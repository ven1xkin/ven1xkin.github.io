    <h2>My Love Letter 💌</h2>
    <p>
      babi,  
      today, everyone is celebrating valentine's day, but to me, <br>
      it feels like they're celebrating you. it's as if the universe<br>
      chose this day to remind everyone what love looks like, and<br>
      the universe gave me you.<br><br>

      dati, valentine's day was just a mere celebration of couples,<br>
      of love itself. but when you came into my life, you gave<br>
      it a whole new meaning. it's the day that love became a<br>
      physical being.<br>
<br>
      the real reason why i cried when i said "i wish you could <br>
      see yourself the way i see you" wasn't just because of<br>
      your appearances, it's also because i want you to see<br>
      how i see you. the way you laugh, the way you smile<br>
      the way you view the world, the way i admire the passion <br>
      you put into subjects you like. i want you to see how <br>
      beautiful your presence is.<br>
<br>
      on a day where everybody celebrates love, i celebrate you<br>
      on a day where everybody celebrates romance, i celebrate your existence<br>
      on your birthday, i celebrate the miracle that you are.<br>

      thank you for being yourself<br>
      thank you for loving me<br>
      i am honored that you chose me<br>
<br>
      if everyone today is celebrating love, it's because you were born
      <br><br>
      i love you and i choose you always my cleoheart
    </p>
